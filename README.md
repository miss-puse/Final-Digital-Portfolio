### 💬 **Reflection (STAR):**

**Situation:** During our Work Readiness training, we learned about professional communication and how to write formal emails. Even though it was not a given task, I decided to apply what I had learned by writing a real email to a company to request an opportunity to complete my Work Integrated Learning (WIL) placement. I wanted to challenge myself and gain real-world experience communicating with employers.

**Task:**  My goal was to compose a professional and respectful email that introduced myself as a Diploma in ICT student at CPUT and to ask if their company could offer me a WIL placement. I needed to make sure that the email was polite, well-structured, and used proper business language. 

**Action:**  To do this, I reviewed examples of professional emails and followed the correct structure ,including a subject line, greeting, body, and closing. I introduced myself, explained what WIL is, and why I was interested in completing it at their company. 

**Result:** Writing this email gave me practical experience in professional communication. It helped me understand how to express myself confidently and respectfully when reaching out to companies. I also learned the importance of tone, structure, and clarity in written communication.

**Task:**  In preparation for our WIL applications, we had to practice interview skills to prepare for possible interviews with companies. The purpose was to help us present ourselves confidently and answer questions effectively

**Action:**  I practiced answering common interview questions such as “Tell me about yourself” and “Why should we hire you?”. I prepared short notes about my academic background, strengths, and experience from class projects. I also practiced my body language, maintaining eye contact, and speaking clearly. I recorded myself during one practice session to evaluate my tone and posture and made improvements based on what I saw.

**Result:** I became more confident when speaking in front of others and learned how to structure my answers using real examples. I now understand how preparation and positive body language can make a strong impression during interviews. This experience made me feel ready for real WIL or job interviews.

## 🎬 **3. MOCK INTERVIEW**

### 💬 **Reflection (STAR):**

**Situation:** As part of our assessment, I participated in a mock interview that simulated a real job interview. This was meant to test our readiness for WIL and future job interviews.

**Task:** I had to act as if I was applying for a WIL placement at an ICT company. The lecturer provided us with a set of interview questions to choose from, and I had to prepare my answers in advance. My goal was to present myself professionally, answer confidently, and apply the STAR technique in my responses.

**Action:** Before the interview, I selected the questions given by my lecturer , such as “Tell me about yourself,” “What are your strengths and weaknesses?” and “Describe a time when you worked well in a team.”
I practiced answering them using the STAR method . I also prepared by wearing professional attire, setting up my interview space neatly, and ensuring my camera and sound were clear. 

**Result:** The mock interview helped me become more confident and aware of how to present myself professionally. I learned how to stay calm, use examples from my experience, and answer questions with structure. 

## 🌐 **4. PROFESSIONAL NETWORKING**

### 🧠 **Evidence:**

Here are my professional networking activities:  

### 💬 **Reflection (STAR):**

**Situation:** We were encouraged to build our professional presence online and connect with people in our field. I decided to focus on improving my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles to network effectively with ICT professionals.

**Task:**   My goal was to create a LinkedIn profile that highlights my education, skills, and career goals, and to keep my GitHub account updated with my projects to showcase my technical abilities.

**Action:**  I updated my LinkedIn with a professional photo, headline, and description of my qualification. I added my academic projects, volunteer work, and soft skills. I also followed ICT-related companies and joined student groups. On GitHub, I uploaded my projects and other coding tasks, ensuring that each repository had a proper description and README file.

**Result:** My LinkedIn and GitHub profiles now look professional and reflect my growth as an ICT student. I started receiving connection requests from other students and professionals, which made me more visible in the tech community. Networking online taught me how to promote myself and engage with potential employers in a professional way.
